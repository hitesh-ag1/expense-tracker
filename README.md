# Expense Tracker

Expense tracker is a server-side application which delivers insights and summaries on your daily expenses. It can be used to compare how your spendings compare with that of your peers and where you can save money.

The applications extracts all your transactions through your email inbox in Outlook, after which it performs basic data cleaning and categorization to deliver insights and summaries like weekly spending pattern, necessary and unnecessary expenses, aggregate spendings on outings, budgeting, spending comparison with friends, etc.

Currently the project is still in an early stage and only the basic functionalities are implemented for university students in Singapore. The aim of this project is to help college students cut down on unnecessary expenses.

This server side application can be deployed on Heroku and be connected to a Telegram bot for a better user experience.
